# Small-Scale-Protein-Secondary-Structure-prediction
Predict coarse protein folding states (alpha-helix, beta-sheet, coil) from sequence without doing full 3D folding.
This repository contains code for predicting protein secondary structure (helix, sheet, coil) from amino acid sequences using CNN and ProtBert fine-tuning.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
